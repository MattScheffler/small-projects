A brief description of each item will be given here.

**Methods.cs:** Miscellaneous methods made in C# for fun or as exercises.

**NumberGuessingGame.py:** The computer tries to guess the number you are thinking of. Default number range is 1 to 100.

**ExerciseCollection.py:** Solutions to some practice problems, all put into functions. 

**Telescopes:** the start of a C++ project for "observing" with different telescope types.

**BinaryConverter:** Converts a positive base 10 integer to binary, with Python and C++ versions. Might add in some bitwise operators eventually.
